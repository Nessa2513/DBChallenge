# Database Challenge
This project is a demo of how to implement JPA using Hibernate in InteliJ IDEA with MySQL.

## Technologies
- InteliJ IDEA 2022.2

## Challenge

1. Create the table institution that will have a relationship with the table employee
   (use foreign key), to show the studies from an employee. Take a screenshot from the

2. Use the Join Clause to get the data from the tables institution and employee
####
3. Use Sub-Queries to get the data from the children whose parents work in PriceSmart
   (idCompany = 5). Note: Get the data only from the table children.

4. Create a Java program using JPA+Hibernate to create a database connection, where
   the user should be able to perform the following actions:
   - Get all records from the table employee 
   - Get employees by last name from the table employee
   - Insert a new record in the table employee
